One of exciting areas in data science today is wearable computing - see for example [this article](https://www.itnews.com/article/2115126/big-data--activity-tracking--and-the-battle-for-the-world-s-top-sports-brand.html). 
Companies like Fitbit, Nike, and Jawbone Up are racing to develop the most advanced algorithms to attract new users.

In this project, data collected from accelerometers and gyroscopes of the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone were retrieved, cleaned, 
and processed to prepare a requested "tidy" data usable for later analysis.

This repo has the following files:

- `README.md`, this file
	- data set overview + creation info
- `CodeBook.md`
	- "code book" - a file that describes the datasets content (such as data, variables and transformations throughout data generation)
- `run_analysis.R`
	- requested R script created to produce the output data set below 
- `tidy_data.txt`
	- requested file with dataset = assignment results
